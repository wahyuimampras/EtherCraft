                    <li><strong>Consultation:</strong> You'll start by contacting us (e.g., via WhatsApp). We'll discuss your budget, what you'll use the keyboard for (gaming, typing, etc.), and your aesthetic preferences.</li>
                    <li><strong>Component Selection:</strong> We'll help you pick every part: the case, layout (60%, 75%, TKL, etc.), PCB, switches, keycaps, and stabilizers.</li>

                  <p>A typical custom build takes <strong>5 to 10 business days</strong> after all components have been sourced and confirmed. If some parts are rare or need to be special-ordered, this timeline may be longer, but we will always be transparent about it during your consultation.</p>

              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>These terms describe the feel and sound of a switch:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Linear:</strong> Smooth and consistent keystroke from top to bottom. They are often quieter and favored by gamers for their speed.</li>
                  <li><strong>Tactile:</strong> You feel a small "bump" on each keystroke, which confirms the key has been pressed. They are excellent for typing.</li>
                  <li><strong>Clicky:</strong> You feel a "bump" *and* hear an audible "click" sound. These are the loudest switches and are very satisfying for some typists.</li>

              <summary class="faq-question">What does "hot-swappable" mean?</summary>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>A "hot-swappable" (or "hot-swap") keyboard has a PCB that allows you to change the mechanical switches simply by pulling the old ones out and pushing new ones in. No soldering is required. This is fantastic for beginners who want to experiment with different switch types easily.</p>

              <summary class="faq-question">What is "switch lubing" and is it worth it?</summary>
              <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Lubing is the process of applying a thin layer of specialized lubricant (like Krytox) to the internal components of a switch (the stem and housing). </p>
                <p><strong>Yes, it is absolutely worth it.</strong> Lubing makes switches feel significantly smoother, reduces "scratchy" sounds, and creates a deeper, more pleasant "thocky" sound profile. It's a standard part of all our premium custom builds.</p>
